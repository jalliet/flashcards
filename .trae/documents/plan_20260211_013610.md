I have analyzed the file structure and the workflow file.

### The Problem
The `run` command in `.github/workflows/release.yml` fails for two reasons:
1.  **Missing Files**: The command tries to zip `SKILL.md`, `references/`, `anki/`, and `artifact/` from the root directory, but these files actually reside in the `flashcards/` subdirectory.
2.  **Incorrect Context**: The `zip -r ../...` command creates the zip file in the parent directory. Without changing directories first, this would create the file outside the GitHub Actions workspace, making it inaccessible to the subsequent release step.

### The Solution
We need to modify the `run` command to:
1.  Change directory into `flashcards/` (`cd flashcards`).
2.  Run the zip command from there.

This achieves two things:
1.  The `zip` command can find the files (`SKILL.md`, etc.).
2.  The output path `../flashcards-...zip` will correctly place the zip file in the **workspace root** (the parent of `flashcards/`), which is exactly where the next step (`action-gh-release`) expects to find it.

### Proposed Changes
I will update `.github/workflows/release.yml`:

```yaml
      - name: Build skill package
        run: |
          cd flashcards
          zip -r ../flashcards-${{ github.ref_name }}.zip \
            SKILL.md \
            references/ \
            anki/ \
            artifact/ \
            -x "README.md" "**/.DS_Store"
```
